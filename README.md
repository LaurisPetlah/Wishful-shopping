## Wishful - putting your shopping all in one place.
Having many shopping carts is difficult to manage when you have so much you want to buy. Wishful puts it all in one place. This chrome extension allows you to scan pages for items you want to save, and places it into a neat portfolio so you can decide what you want to buy... later!
